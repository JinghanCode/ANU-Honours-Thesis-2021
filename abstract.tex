Hybrid testing is an approach to testing where we combine different testing approaches by running a single set of tests with multiple testing backends leading to greater test coverage. Property based testing is a testing technique where tests specify properties for possible test inputs which are used to generate concrete test cases to find bugs in the system under test. Symbolic testing is another technique which involves executing a program symbolically to test all viable execution paths in a program. Despite the apparent advantages of combining concrete property based testing and symbolic testing, hybrid concrete/symbolic testing has seen limited adoption and hasnâ€™t yet been applied in python applications.To this end a novel approach for hybrid concrete/symbolic testing in python is proposed. This involves running a test twice with a concrete property based testing tool Hypothesis and a symbolic solver-based tool Crosshair. This is provided by building support for reading Hypothesis tests into Crosshair. The implementation was then validated using various benchmarks and real-world bug hunting with open-source projects. TODO summarise findings.
