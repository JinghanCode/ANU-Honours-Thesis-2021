\chapter{Design and Implementation}
\label{cha:design}

This chapter presents how Crosshair is extended to execute Hypothesis tests for implementing hybrid concrete/symbolic testing in Python.

\section{Converting Strategies for Crosshair}
\label{sec:des-hotpath}

The initial implementation for concolic testing was achieved by converting strategies into crosshair pre-conditions and symbolic inputs for testing with crosshair. Hypothesis strategies specify properties about test inputs to be generated. Thus, it's fairly straightforward to convert these properties into logical statements which can be evaluated by Pythonâ€™s inbuilt eval function. For example, given a hypothesis test:

\begin{figure}[H]
    \lstinputlisting[linewidth=\textwidth,breaklines=true]{code/div_zero_test.py}
    \caption{Failing Hypothesis Test}
    \label{fig:python:hello}
\end{figure}

\section{Summary}
Same as the last chapter, summarize what you discussed in this chapter and
be a bridge to next chapter.
